        I am a creator, visionary, artist, and inventor. Since I was only six or
        seven years old, I have been composing numerous works of curious merit,
        including the evocative "Hawk to a Mouse", a study of the captivating
        bird mid-hunt, currently on display in the Skibidee Museum in Ohio.
